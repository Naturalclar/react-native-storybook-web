# react-native-storybook-web

A react-native project template with storybook integration.

# What is it about?

This repository is to show that a react-native project can be tested on Web, using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

You can see how it is set up by viewing the [.storybook](/.storybook) directory

This project is started up using `react-native init`, but you can also have the same setup on an app made with `expo`
